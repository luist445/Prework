## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Since my friend told me about CodePath just yesterday, I had to quickly learn how to use xCode. My biggest challenge is not clearly understanding Github. I had difficulties knowing what to push and commit. Hopefully, I pushed all the required documents. I apologize for the lack of features, I didn't know there was a course like this offered in our school, so I had to quickly make the app. If selected, I will ensure that I devote more time and effort into the project.
